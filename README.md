# Durham, NC Permits

A permit viewer for the City of Durham, North Carolina.

1. Gets data from the [All Building
   Permits](https://live-durhamnc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/DurhamNC::all-building-permits/about)
   dataset for a range of dates.
2. Filters permits based on type, activity, and text.
3. Displays the matching permits in a table and on a map.
4. Centers the map on a selected permit and shows its details.

The [Durham Open Data Portal](https://live-durhamnc.opendata.arcgis.com/) ArcGIS server has these
capabilities and more. I find this app simpler and faster for my use cases:

- What's being done to that building or lot I passed by recently?
- What's coming to town?
